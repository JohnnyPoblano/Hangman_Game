# Cheating Hangman

This project started as an assignment in one of my first programming classes. The premise is that you play hangman against the CPU and the CPU is allowed to change words mid game without telling you; as long as the letters line up with the already correctly guessed letters.

# Running the Game

Clone this repo and enter the directory. Then run `javac *.java` which will compile all java source code. Then run `java Hangman`.

# Notes

Its currently a work in progress as I go back and look at the old code. I will be refactoring and rewriting a lot of the game logic eventually.
